D-Bus is a message bus that Linux systems use in order to make programs communicate with each other or with the system itself. It allows applications to integrate amongst themselves using well-defined interfaces. This allows each application to provide services that can be used by others, sort of like adding APIâ€™s to your programs.

Here I have implemented a small D-Bus service and a client to consume it. It returns the current time.

## How to run it

Run the service we wrote in a terminal and run the client from another terminal, you should get the time printed on your console.

To run the service.
```
python dbusservice.py
```

To run the client.
```
python dbus-client.py
```
